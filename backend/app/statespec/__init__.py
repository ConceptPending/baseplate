"""Declarative state-machine specs with a generic enforcement engine.

A *spec* is a plain-data description of an entity's lifecycle: its states,
the named transitions between them, who (which roles) may fire each
transition, and the guard predicates that must hold. The same artifact is:

- **human-readable** — `render.to_mermaid` / `render.to_table` turn it into a
  diagram and a plain-English table a non-engineer can sign off on;
- **machine-checkable** — `core.validate` proves the graph is coherent
  (no unreachable or stuck states) and `core.apply` is the single, generic
  interpreter every service-layer transition goes through, so the code
  *cannot* drift from the spec without a test noticing.

The engine here is deliberately domain-agnostic: it knows nothing about
any domain. Domain specs live next to their slice (see `batch_spec`).
